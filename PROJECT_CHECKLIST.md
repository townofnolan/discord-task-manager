## Implementation Notes

### Priority Levels
- **High Priority**: Core functionality (sections 1-5, 13)
- **Medium Priority**: Enhanced features (sections 6-8, 14)
- **Future Enhancements**: Advanced features (sections 9-12, 15)

### Dependencies
- Some features have dependencies on others (e.g., UI components depend on core models)
- Natural Language Processing and Calendar Integration can be implemented independently
- Testing should be implemented alongside each feature
- Documentation should be updated continuously

### Estimated Timeline
- **Phase 1** (Weeks 1-4): Project setup, core models, basic bot framework
- **Phase 2** (Weeks 5-8): Task management, project management, basic UI
- **Phase 3** (Weeks 9-12): Advanced UI, threading, time tracking
- **Phase 4** (Weeks 13-16): Smart scheduling, NLP, calendar integration
- **Phase 5** (Weeks 17-20): Testing, deployment, documentation

This checklist serves as a living document and should be updated as the project evolves.
