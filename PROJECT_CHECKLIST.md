## Implementation Notes

### Priority Levels [UPDATED FOR COUPLE USAGE]
- **Highest Priority**: Core functionality with focus on daily schedule view and notifications
- **High Priority**: Simple shared dashboard, recurring tasks, overdue alerts
- **Medium Priority**: Enhanced features that improve usability
- **Lower Priority**: Advanced features like NLP, AI scheduling

### Dependencies
- Focus on features that enable a shared calendar/task view first
- Simplify team management to just handle two users
- Calendar integration moved to higher priority for shared scheduling
- Recurring tasks are critical for managing regular household chores

## Conclusion & Next Steps

This implementation plan has been refocused to create a practical couples' task management system in significantly less time than the original plan intended for team use.

### Immediate Focus Areas
1. Implement recurring tasks for regular household chores
2. Create daily and weekly view of shared schedule
3. Build morning and evening task summaries
4. Implement simple categorization for task organization

### Timeline
- **Phase 1** (1-2 weeks): Complete core task management + implement recurring tasks
- **Phase 2** (2-3 weeks): Build daily schedule view, shared dashboard, and daily summaries
- **Phase 3** (1-2 weeks): Add overdue alerts, improve notification system, simple time tracking
- **Phase 4** (1 week): Testing with real usage, deployment, and basic documentation

By focusing on these practical features first, the system will quickly become useful for daily household and relationship task management, with the opportunity to add more advanced features over time as needed.
