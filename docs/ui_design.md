# Discord Dashboard UI Design

This design outlines how the bot presents a simple dashboard inside Discord using interactive components.

## Layout

- **Pages**: The dashboard is structured as pages within an embed. Navigation buttons allow switching between an overview page, task list, and member list.
- **Buttons**: Each page includes action buttons such as "Add Member" or "Create Task".
- **Text Entry**: Forms are displayed using Discord modals so users can fill in required information in a single dialog.
- **Color Selection**: When creating a project the bot now shows a dropdown list of colors rather than requiring a hex code.

These components let users manage projects without leaving Discord.
